# APC_64_40_9

Remote script for the Akai APC40 with Ableton Live 9. Adds an 8 8 channel + master VU-meter display on the APC40 grid in mode 8. Useful as a mixing mode or as a makeshift visualizer when playing live, and makes it much easier to know which track you're selecting or adjusting without referring to your monitor.

Installation
------------
To install the script, just download this repository and move the entire “APC_64_40_9″ containing folder to the Ableton Remote Scripts directory. On Windows, it should be at:
“C:\Program Files\Ableton\Live 8.x.x\Resources\MIDI Remote Scripts\”.

On Mac OS X, find the Ableton application file and right click -> “Show Package Contents”. You’ll find the Remote Script folder in
“Contents/App-Resources/MIDI Remote Scripts”.

Once the script is in place, launch Live and open the preferences window. In the “MIDI / Sync” tab, you’ll find a listing of your connected MIDI gear. Find your APC40, and in the left column, change the default selection to “APC 64 40 vu”. Hold the shift button and press the various Track Selection buttons to switch modes. If the clip grid changes to show new layouts, it’s installed correctly.
